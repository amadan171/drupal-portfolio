# **Drupal Portfolio (Custom Theme)**

Personal portfolio implemented with **Drupal**.

I built the content of this website using Drupal and exposed them as REST endpoints. I used a boilerplate which I further developed. I've listed the files on which I've mainly worked on. I also used AI(mainly ChatGPT) to help me navigate this new tech stack. It is currently hosted at https://ecfa70a69cf3.ngrok-free.app/portfolio over https through my local machine. But since the tunnel connection is unstable, I have attached screenshots.

I initially made a very rough template of the website and was directly able to host it through github. It can be viewed here - https://amadan171.github.io/portfolio/

It is very similar to the drupal site I developed.
